                <h2>What is Mindfulness?</h2>
                <p>"Mindfulness is awareness that arises through paying attention, on purpose, in the ,present moment,
                    non-judgementally"
                    <br>

            <h2>Reasons to Practise Mindfuless</h2>
            <div>
                Mindfulness promotes neuroplasticity, changing our brains previous neural networks into using more of
                the
                grey matter within the brain which is associated with focus, decision-making and memory.
            </div>
            <div>
                By focusing on the here and now, a pillar of mindfulness practise, mindfulness help reduce rumination
                and
                worrying about things that are outside of oour control. By doing this, mindfulness can greatly improve
                mental
                health.
            </div>
            <div>
                Mindfulness has been found to positively impact relationships. Mindfulness encourages an attitude of
                acceptance and staying present in the moment, this allows us to be fully present when we are with our
                loved
                ones and acknowledging that we all have imperfections but accepting these and loving them anyway.
            </div>
            <div>
                When mindfulness meditation is practised regularly it decreases heart rate and blood pressure as well as
                increasing serotinin and melatonin. These results not only help our overall general health but greatly
                reduces the severity of insomnia, helping us to sleep better each night.
