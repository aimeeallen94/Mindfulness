                aside
                some time
                for a retreat, a day of mindfulness, when we can walk slowly, smile, drink tea with a friend, enjoy
                being together as if we are the happiest people on Earth.”

            <h3>Cliffs Retreat Cottage</h3>
            <br>
            <p>We will begin our Mountain and Meditation Morning in our cottage with a grounding meditation and some
                light, freshly baked refreshments before setting out to hike one of our gorgeous nearby mountains.
                Here you will be given time to both take in the mountain, its views and to pay attention to your
                body as you exercise. We will also guide you throught a walking meditation as we move. We will
                return
                to the cottage for some gentle stretching, breathwork and a final meditation before we finish the
                day.
                We hope this short retreat provides you with the space you need to check in with yourself.
