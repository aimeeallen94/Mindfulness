# The Mindful Way

The Mindful Way website is a website for people who are both interested in and curious about mindfulness. The Mindful Way website provides information about upcoming courses and events lead by the team and offers those who are intersted to sign up to a newsletter and receive meditation videos also. This site is targeted towards anyone who is interested in Mindfulness and encourages a community spirit among those who are members of it.

The concept of this website was to maintain a mindful design theme to further enshance the main theme of the website.

## Features

### Navigation
- At the top of the screen, within the navigation bar, at the left corner is the wesbite name, which is also an active link that brings you to the home page of the website when clicked.
- Within the navigation on the right side of the screen contains the other navigation links which are: Home, Courses and Events and Sign Up which when clicked bring you to different pages within the Mindful Way website.
- The font chosen for the navigation is clearly seen on the white background and also further enhances the mindful tone of this website by not being a calming colour that is not too loud. 
- The navigation links are clearly laid out and once hovered over increase in size making it very clear to see which link is about to be selected.
- When completing the responsive design of this website the navigation bar was changed slightly so that the logo appeared on the top line and the navigation links appeared on the line below this when viewed on smaller screens, this allowed all content to be esaily viewed without needing to be unnecessarily reduced in size to fit into the space.

## Credits
- The set up and design of this website was based upon the Love Running and Coding Club webpages in order to get this website up and running. From there I applied my own style and design ideas.
- My tutor told me about the Flex function and [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) to use instead of the float function whcch greatly helped with the styling of the Reasons to Practise sextion. I used [this](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp) W3 Schools Flexbox tutorial to learn how to apply this styke rule.
- I used [this thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32426401/embeded-youtube-video-error) from Stack Overflow to embed the video in the webpage as I was having difficulty getting to work when attempting to copy and paste video link into an iframe tag.

Researched CSS ideas to change list order but was uncuccessful in working this out. Tried creating ids for each list item and setting them to order with their corresponding place but this was unsuccessful.
Styled nav elements and logo image using animation with the image zooming in once the website is opened. Rule wasn't working at the start but I had missed a ";" on the line above the animation rule starting!
Styled hero image with zoom in once page is clicked, tried to style zoom out image once clicked but this left white panels on either side of image so decided to go with zoom out instead.

used inline css styling to keep each reason box an equal size being 25% width of the paghr. styled reasons box by adding padding.
